							<h2>// ABOUT US</h2>
							<p class="chapeau">
								Together, we are greater than the sum of our parts. Corde represents a new level of excellence in the integrated design and delivery of building projects.
							</p>
							<p>
								Corde is based on our belief that high quality, efficient design is a group effort. Together, our design response is more inspired, better considered, and more consistently delivered.
							</p>
							<p>
								The reason is simple. Uniting architecture, structural engineering, and mechanical and electrical design, we avoid traditional 'silos' of expertise. Instead, we bring our staff together around a table. Working so closely together, questions can be answered more quickly, and ideas shared more easily. Right from the beginning, through every design stage, our teams are genuinely talking: asking questions, solving problems and sharing expertise.
							</p>
							<p>
								We utilise Building Information Modelling (BIM) to create a responsive design solution. Models are adapted and adjusted in real-time, allowing our teams to progress rapidly. Integrated building data allows us to test and analyse performance, reducing risk and improving quality and deliverability.
							</p>
							<p>
								For our clients, the result is a more agile and efficient process that doesn't compromise on creativity or quality.
